This project is a data tracking tool designed to monitor the performance of students in different subjects across various terms or quarters. It provides the functionality to view examination results based on selected dates and allows users to choose specific student names to access detailed information.

The primary purpose of the project is to offer insights into student performance by utilizing line charts as the main visualization method. Line charts are effective for illustrating trends and changes over time, making them suitable for representing the academic progress of students across different terms.

The project likely incorporates a user-friendly interface where users can select specific dates to view examination results for a particular term. This feature enables users to analyze performance patterns over time and identify any improvements or declines in the academic achievements of students.

Furthermore, the project offers the ability to choose individual student names to access more detailed information. This feature allows users to delve into the performance of specific students, providing a comprehensive view of their progress, strengths, and weaknesses.

By leveraging these features, users can gain a deeper understanding of student performance trends and make informed decisions to support their academic growth. The combination of visual representation and interactive elements in this project enhances the user experience and facilitates data exploration and analysis.
